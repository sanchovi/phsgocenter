          <li> Start a list of your awards, honors, paid and volunteer work, and extracurricular activities. Update it throughout high school.</li>

          <li>Explore reasons to consider college, and don’t be afraid to ask for help from your parents, school counselor, and older students as you prepare.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="sophomore">
        <ul>
          <li>Meet with your school counselor or mentor to discuss colleges and their requirements.</li>

        <h5>To Do: All Year</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://studentaid.gov/resources/prepare-for-college/students/choosing-schools">Learn about choosing a college<a></li>
          <li>Go to college fairs and college-preparation presentations hosted by college representatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To Do: Fall</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask about <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10">taking the PSAT</a>. You must take the test in 11th grade to qualify for scholarships and programs associated with the National Merit Scholarship Program.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To Do: Spring</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Register for and take exams for college admission. The standardized tests that many colleges require are the SAT, the SAT Subject Tests, and the ACT. Check with the colleges you are interested in to see what tests they require.</li>
          <li><a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/scholarships">Use a free scholarship search</a> to find scholarships for which you might want to apply. Some deadlines fall as early as the summer between 11th and 12th grades, so prepare now to submit applications soon.</li>
          <li>Find out what government financial aid you can apply for, and how, in <a href="https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/aid-glance-2019-20.pdf">Federal Student Aid at a Glance.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To Do: Summer Before Senior Year</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a username and password called an FSA ID that you’ll use to confirm your identity when accessing your government financial aid information and electronically signing your federal student aid documents. <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/how-to-create-fsa-id-username-password">Learn about the FSA ID, and create yours.</a> <strong>Note: You must create your own FSA ID; if your parent creates it for you, that’ll cause confusion later and will slow down the financial aid application process.</strong> </li>
          <li>Narrow down the list of colleges you are considering attending. If you can, visit the schools that interest you.</li>
          <li>Contact colleges or check their websites to find information and applications for admission. Ask about financial aid, admission requirements, and deadlines</li>
          <li>Decide whether you are going to apply for admission under a particular college’s early decision, early action, or regular decision program. Be sure to learn about the program deadlines and requirements.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="senior">
        <h5>To Do: All Year</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Work hard all the way to graduation—second-semester grades can affect scholarship eligibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To Do: Fall</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>As soon as possible after its Oct. 1 release, complete and submit your FAFSA® form, along with any other financial aid applications your chosen school(s) may require. You should submit your FAFSA form by the earliest financial aid deadline of the schools to which you are applying, usually by early February</li>
          <li>After you submit the FAFSA form, you should receive your Student Aid Report (SAR) within three days to three weeks. This document lists your answers to the questions on your FAFSA form and gives you some basic information about your aid eligibility. Quickly make any necessary corrections and submit them to the FAFSA processor.</li>
          <li>If you haven’t done so already, register for and take the standardized tests required for college admission. Check with the colleges you are interested in to see what tests they require.</li>
          <li>Apply to the colleges you have chosen. Prepare your applications carefully. Follow the instructions, and <strong>PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO DEADLINES!</strong></li>
          <li>Well before your college application deadlines, ask your counselor and teachers to submit the required documents (e.g., transcript, letters of recommendation) to the colleges to which you’re applying.</li>
          <li>Complete any last scholarship applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>To Do: Spring</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Visit colleges that have invited you to enroll.</li>
          <li>Review your college acceptances and compare the colleges’ financial aid offers.</li>
          <li>Contact a school’s financial aid office if you have questions about the aid that school has offered you. In fact, getting to know your financial aid staff early is a good idea no matter what—they can tell you about deadlines, other aid for which you might wish to apply, and important paperwork you might need to submit.</li>
          <li>When you decide which school you want to attend, notify that school of your commitment and submit any required financial deposit. Many schools require this notification and deposit by May 1.</li>
